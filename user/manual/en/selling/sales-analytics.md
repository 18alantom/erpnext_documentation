# Sales Analytics Reports

With the ability to see and analyze your sales data in different views, data is able to diagnose and analyze to better understand how sales are performing.  The data allows for filters to be altered dynamically with criteria selections through filters. There are three window areas that make up the Sales Analytics Report. The Filter Toolbar Window, the Graph Window and the Data Window.  Please see the example below.

These analytics can be found in **Selling > Analytics**.
### 1. The Filter Toolbar Window

### 2. Data Analytics and Charts

Within the data window, selections can be made to expand or compress the data to be analyzed.  At the left of the window, (blue), are selection boxes. Each box can be selected for use. There is no restriction for the data comparison, so a higher level can be compared to lower levels.  The data column to the right, (orange), contains selection boxes with + and minus selections. Selecting a + will expand the data and selecting a â€“ will compress the data. As this is performed, the Graph Window is dynamically altered allowing rapid data analysis.

Accessing the Filter Window, the company and date ranges can be applied.  Data is updated in the Data Window as changes are applied.
  
Within the Data Window, columns of information are accessible. The label at the top of each column can be selected by hovering over the column heading and clicking. This will sort the data by this column in  an ascending or descending fashion. As well, the open data entry field immediately below the column can be used to further refine by filtering the data.  The following example demonstrates data that has been sorted in ascending order by total (orange) and has been filtered for the year 2018 (blue).
