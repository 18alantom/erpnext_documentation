# Buying

If your business involves physical goods, buying is one of your core business
activities. Your suppliers are as important as your customers and they must be
provided with accurate information.

Buying the right quantities at right amounts can affect your cash flow and
profitability positively. ERPNext contains a set of transactions that will make your buying process as
efficient and seamless as possible.
