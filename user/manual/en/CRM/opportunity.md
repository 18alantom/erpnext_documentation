It is important to reach out to opportunities from time to time and build the relationship. You can set the 'Next Contact Date' and 'Next Contact By' fields and a calendar event will be added for the user chosen in 'Next Contact By' field and a notification is shown on the that Date.

#### 2.2 Creating Quotation and Supplier Quotation
You can create a Quotation from the Make dropdown. Relevant field values will be copied over.

In some businesses, users collect the rates from their supplier against the customer requirement and based on the supplier rates they prepare the quotation for the customer. With ERPNext, you can make a supplier quotation from the opportunity itself.
