# Customer Group

Customer groups allow you to organize your customers. You can have discounts based on customer groups.
You can also get trend analysis for each group. Typically Customers are grouped by market segment (that is usually based on your domain).

### 1. How to create a Customer Group
1. Go to **CRM > Setup > Customer Group > New**.
2. Enter a name for the Customer Group.
3. Tick the Group Node checkbox if you want to add more child node customer groups inside this one.
4. Save.

> Tip: If you think all this is too much effort, you can leave it at “Default
Customer Group”. But all this effort, will pay off when you start getting
reports. An example of a sample report is given below:
