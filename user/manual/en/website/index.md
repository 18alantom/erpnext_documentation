# Website

Websites are a core component of any business and having a good website
usually means running into obstacles like investing lot of money, difficulty to update, and not being interactive.
Unless you are a web designer yourself, wouldn't it be nice if there was a way to update your product catalog on your site automatically from your ERP?
We thought exactly the same and hence built a small Website Development app
right inside ERPNext! Using ERPNextâ€™s Website module, you can:

  1. Create Web Pages
  2. Write a Blog
  3. Publish your Product Catalog using the Item master

We will soon be adding a shopping cart facility so that your customers can
place orders and pay you online!

Though not necessary, to make a good website, you might have to know a bit of
HTML / CSS or hire the services of a professional. The good part is that once
this is setup, you can add and edit content, blogs and products directly from
your ERP.
 
You can check out **[this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyW6mfFBSNw)** for a demonstration of the Website module in ERPNext.
